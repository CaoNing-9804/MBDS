I judged weather the point (X, Y) is inside polygon by the following steps:
1.draw a horizontal line y = Y, going through the point
2.calculate the X coordinate of the points, at which the horizon line and the edges of the polygon intersect.
3. if the number of intersection points in the left of (X, Y) is odd, as well as the number if points in the right, (X,Y)is inside the polygon.

vector is a kind of linear data structure, which can be search by index
sort is a function which is implemented with  quick sorting algorithm, and it has three parameters, the beginning and the end of the vector, and the way to compare.
